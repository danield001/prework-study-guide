# prework-study-guide

## Description


The prework-study-guide helps organise and store information learnt during the prework section of coding bootcamp. As content and information can be quite heavy for a new coder, by creating such a site, it gives a better understanding of how data is coded, whilst storing information relevent to the course. By  having such a resource, it allows us to have all the content in one site, whilst also teaching the ability to use HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. From this, the material learnt was HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, which is all prevelent in the coding aspect of the site, whilst also keeping tabs on what was learnt.
